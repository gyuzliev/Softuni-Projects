// // 10-Spice-Must-Flow

// // Spice is Love, Spice is Life. And most importantly, Spice must flow. 
// It must be extracted from the scorching sands of Arrakis, under constant threat of giant sand worms. 
// To make the work as efficient as possible, the Duke has tasked you with the creation of a management software. 
// // Write a JS program that calculates the total amount of spice that can be extracted from a source. 
// The source has a starting yield, which indicates how much spice can be mined on the first day. 
// After it has been mined for a day, the yield drops by 10, meaning on the second day it’ll produce 10 less 
// spice than on the first, on the third day 10 less than on the second, and so on (see examples).
//  A source is considered profitable only while its yield is at least 100 – when less than 100 
//  spice is expected in a day, abandon the source. 
// // The mining crew consumes 26 spice every day at the end of their shift and an additional 
// 26 after the mine has been exhausted. Note that the workers cannot consume more spice than there is in storage. 
// // When the operation is complete, print on the console on two separate lines how many days the mine has
//  operated and the total amount of spice extracted. 
// // Input 
// // You will receive number, representing the starting yield of the source. 
// // Output 
// // Print on the console on two separate lines how many days the mine has operated and the total amount of spice extracted.
// //  Constraints 
// // •	The starting yield will be a number within range [0…228] 


// // Examples
// // Input	Output	Explanation
// // 111	2
// // 134	Day 1 we extract 111 spice and at the end of the shift, the workers consume 26, leaving 85. The yield drops by 10 to 101. 
// // Day 2 we extract 101 spice, the workers consume 26, leaving 75. The total is 160 and the yield has dropped to 91.
// // Since the expected yield is less than 100, we abandon the source. The workers take another 26, leaving 134. The mine has operated 2 days.
